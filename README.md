## 🛠️List of tweaks🛠️

### 🥕AutoHarvest
Tired of breaking crops and replanting them? This plugin lets players auto harvest and replant crops by right-clicking them!

### 💩CopperOresDropCoal
Copper is not useful enough. Copper ores now drop coal, since coal is more useful.

### 🪽BatMembranes
Did you disable phantoms from your world? With this plugin, you can still get membranes by killing bats. Bats now drop membranes.

### 🧭DeathCoordinates
By default, items despawn within 5 mins. Spend less time retracing your steps by knowing exactly where you died.

### ⚰️DeathCounter
When you die, the server now announces how many deaths you have to everyone.

### 🧵WoolToString
String can be turned into wool blocks. This plugin allows the vice-versa. It can also allow you to make a bed from different colored wool.

### 🪨OreGenerator
Cobblestone generators are no more. This plugin replaces the cobblestone with ores or stone.

### 🪜FastAscend
This plugin lets player swim up faster. It also allows them to climb ladders/vines faster.
